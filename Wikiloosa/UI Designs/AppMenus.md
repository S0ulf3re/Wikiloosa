#  App Menus

Adhering to the Apple Human Interface guidelines, The default menus will include:

I am going to go more in depth in these below

To be kind to the kind folks who are making this project exist in the first place, and are doing far more loads of work maintaining it (especially considering they are doing it for free), I wish to include a link to [donate to Wikipedia](https://donate.wikimedia.org).
