#  The Wikiloosa Manifesto


## About this document
This document describes the ideologies I want to follow, as well as the pitfalls I want to avoid when designing the front end for Wikiloosa. To start, I will include 3 core guidelines:

- Designed for macOS only
- Designed for avid Wikipedia readers
- Designed for avid and beginning Wikipedia editors

NOTE: This is a breathing document and is subject to change over time!

I will go more in depth into these:



##Designed for macOS Only 

I have decided that Wikiloosa is to remain solely on macOS. My reasoning for this is because of the fact that there are already several Wikipedia clients for iOS (Including one that was designed by one of the developers behind the main Wikipedia library that this project uses), and the ones that already exist are perfectly fine already and work for even the more savvy users.


### What about Dictionary.app?

Yes, the dictionary app has Wikipedia support, but it's really only designed for looking up things that go beyond the Dictionary app's field of expertise, and isn't really well suited for long-term sessions. Which brings me to my next guideline


##Designed for avid Wikipedia Readers

I want Wikiloosa to feel like we took Wikipedia, and smashed it into a singular window on the Desktop. This means that the app should make extensive use of some of the most useful features on macOS and should have as much of Wikipedia as possible. One of the features that I want to nail down extensively well is Look up & Data Detectors. Which allows you to use the force touchpad to lookup a word. I feel that this feature would be perfect for quickly learning what a WikiLink is in the moment, and might possibly help combat the infamous wiki walk ;-)

One of the other things I want to take advantage of is


##Designed for avid and beginning Wikipedia editors

In addition to being able to read the free encyclopeda, I feel that you should also be able to write to the free encyclopedia as well. While I haven't personally viewed all the API functions yet, I want to try to provide as much as I can to help show how easy it can be for new editors to help by providing an easy edit button to switch seamlessly between reading and writing. In other words, I want to make editing Wikipedia feel less intimidating by helping users understand the sites many different templates and making it easier to understand the different jargon thrown around on the site, [especially when other users bring up the WP pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:ALPHABETTISPAGHETTI).

At the same time, I want Wikiloosa to be the tool of choice for professional editors, and I want to do that by providing advanced options for those users, some of these concepts being things I thought of as personal annoyances while browising Wikipedia myself. These will be explained further in detail within the ideas folder of this directory.
