#  Hotfixing

Ever noticed something like a typo in an article? Doing that on Wikipedia is currently a pain because you have to click edit and then go into the source and find it. Even with the visual editor, there's still the burden of writing an edit description. My solution for this is a feature that I call Hotfixing. 

Hotfixing will allow you to create quick edits with an automatically generated edit description. 




An example:


Suppose this sentence is an introduction to an article about Cheese:

> Cheez is a kind of food formed from dairy.

Notice how the first word is spelled incorrectly as the result of a typo. If you, the reader, were to stumble upon this and be annoyed by it, you would have to go into "Edit Source" and read through a bunch of garbage to find it. Of course, you could always use "Find and Replace All" to fix it and any other potential, but what if the article mentions the snack cracker "Cheez-it" and that gets caught in the crossfire as well?

Hotfixing to the rescue!

After enabling the feature from the Menu Bar, you will be able to see misspelled words without actually being in edit mode. From there, you can highlight and Secondary Click the word and select it's correct spelling.

Another feature would be for working with pronouns and other edits that would require changing a word entirely. A notorious example would be replacing "is" with "was" on an article for a recently deceased celebrity.

Once you have made your changes, Wikiloosa will automatically submit your change as a minor edit with an edit summary that will clearly describe your changes for you. In the case of our example, it would be something like:

> ("Cheeze" Hotfixed to "Cheese" using Wikiloosa for macOS)

##Limitations

Hotfixing is designed for doing **minor** edits (As defined by Wikipedia) and is designed to stay out of the way when highlighting large sections of text. You will not be able to add or remove words with Hotfixing, only modify them. It also won't be enabled by default or have it's own section, to stay out of the way of users who are only trying to highlight text.

To reduce the burden of revising on other editors in thee instance someone hotfixes something that was already correct or en *sic*, each Hotfix will be made as it's own individual edit. This way, other editors can easily undo it should someone accidentally Hotfix something that was already correct.

Hotfixing will also be unavailable while in edit mode to avoid redundency
